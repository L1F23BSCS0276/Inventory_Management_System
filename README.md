📦 Inventory Management System (C++)

This is a **C++ Inventory Management System** that allows users to efficiently manage product records.  
The system includes features such as adding, removing, modifying, searching, displaying, and saving products using file handling and dynamic memory allocation.

This project demonstrates strong fundamentals of **C++**, including pointers, arrays, file I/O, string handling, and modular programming.

🚀 Features

✔ Add new products  
✔ Remove products (by name or index)  
✔ Modify product details  
✔ Search product by name  
✔ Display full inventory  
✔ Generate report file  
✔ Save data to file  
✔ Load saved data on startup  
✔ Uses dynamic memory for product list  

🧠 Concepts Used

- Dynamic memory (`new`, `delete`)
- Arrays & strings (`char[]`)
- File handling (`ifstream`, `ofstream`)
- Modular programming (multiple functions)
- Searching & modifying data
- Formatting output using `<iomanip>`

📂 File Structure

Inventory-Management-System/
│── inventory.cpp        # Main C++ source code
│── inventory_data.txt   # Auto-generated data file
│── inventory_report.txt # Optional generated report
│── README.md

📌 How It Works

1️⃣ On startup, program loads saved data (if exists)  
2️⃣ User chooses an option from menu  
3️⃣ Data is processed and stored dynamically  
4️⃣ On exit, data is saved into a file  

======= Inventory Management System =======

1. Add Product
